The Fair Car Price Prediction project employs machine learning, utilizing historical sales data and advanced regression techniques, to empower buyers and sellers with informed decisions while enhancing market transparency. The model incorporates Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Lasso Regression algorithms. Achieving accuracies of 88.75% for Random Forest, 76.26% for Decision Tree, 29.09% for Linear Regression, and 27.03% for Lasso Regression, the project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting fair car prices. This initiative not only facilitates reliable pricing strategies but also contributes to creating a more transparent and equitable marketplace for automotive transactions.
